	      <p>The ActivityPub protocol is a social networking protocol based upon

	      implementing and working with the OStatus and Pump.io protocols.</p>

	    <section id="Overview">
	      <h2>Overview</h2>
	      <p>The ActivityPub protocol is broadly based on the distribution of
	      <i>activities</i>, described using [[!ActivityStreams]]; these activities
	      are produced in response to a user performing an action. Most activities
	      are purely responsive in nature - they are produced as a response to a
	      user <i>having</i> done something. In addition, certain actions posted
	      by a user to their <a href="#outbox">outbox</a> may trigger certain
	      operations on the user's behalf. Finally, actions may have side effects
	      as they propagate throughout the social graph. As an example of this:</p>
	      <ol>
	        <li>A user posts the <code>like</code> activity to their outbox. This
	        activity causes the user's server to perform an action on behalf of
	        the user; in particular, it adds the specified object to the collection
	        of objects the user has liked.</li>
	        <li>A consequence of the above action (per
	        <a href="#notification"></a>) is that the server hosting
	        the liked object will be notified of the operation, and will normally
	        add the activity to the list of "likes" the object has received.</li>
	        <li>Finally, the server receiving the like will distribute this activity
	        to everyone it distributed the original object to.</li>
	      </ol>
	    </section>
	    <section id="specification-profiles">
	      <h2>Specification Profiles</h2>
	      <p>This specification defines two closely related and interacting
	      protocols:</p>
	      <dl>
	        <dt>A client to server protocol, or "Social API"</dt>
	        <dd>This protocol permits a client to act <i>on behalf</i> of a user.
	        For example, this protocol is used by a mobile phone application to
	        interact with the user's social stream</dd>
	        <dt>A server to server protocol, or "Federation Protocol"</dt>
	        <dd>This protocol is used to distribute activities between users on
	        different servers, tying them into one social graph.</dd>
	      </dl>
	      <p>All servers claiming conformance to this specification are required to
	      implement the former protocol, and may optionally implement the latter.
	      This gives three conformance classes:</p>
	      <dl>
	        <dt>ActivityPub conformant Client</dt>
	        <dd>This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety
	        of the client portion of the client to server protocol</dd>
	        <dt>ActivityPub conformant Server</dt>
	        <dd>This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety
	        of the server portion of the client to server protocol</dd>
	        <dt>ActivityPub conformant Federated Server</dt>
	        <dd>This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of
	        the server portion of both the client to server and federation
	        protocols</dd>
	      </dl>
	      <p>It is called out whenever a portion of the specification only applies
	      to implementation of the federation protocol. In addition, whenever
	      requirements are specified, it is called out whether they apply to the
	      client or server (for the client-to-server protocol) or which of a pair of
	      servers in the server-to-server protocol.</p>
	    </section>
	  </section>
	
	  <section id="obj">
	    <h2>Objects</h2>
	    <p>Objects are the core concept around which both [[!ActivityStreams]] and
	    ActivityPub are built. Objects can be divided into three main categories:
	    <a href="#activities">Activities</a>, <a href="#content-objects">Content
	    Objects</a> and <a href="#actors">Actors</a>, plus a small collection of
	    objects which do not fit into the previous categories such as
	    <a href="#groups">groups</a>.</p>
	    <p>Servers MUST validate the content they receive to avoid content spoofing
	    attacks. In particular, servers MUST NOT trust client submitted content, and
	    federated servers also MUST NOT trust content received from a server other than the content's
	    origin. Servers MUST validate such against its originating server.</p>
	    <div class="informative">
	      As an example, if example.com receives the activity
	      <pre class="example">
	       {
	         "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
	         "@type": "Like",
	         "actor": "https://example.net/~mallory",
	         "object": {
	           "@id": "https://example.org/~alice/note/23",
	           "author": "https://example.org/~alice",
	           "content": "I'm a goat"
	         }
	       }
	      </pre>
	      it should dereference the <code>id</code> both to ensure that it exists
	      and is a valid object, and that it is not misrepresenting the object.
	      (In this example, Mallory is likely spoofing an object allegedly posted
	      by Alice.)

	    <div class="issue">Mention requirement of <em>JSON-LD @context</em></div>
	    <section id="obj-id">
	      <h2>Object Identifiers</h2>
	      <p>All Objects in [[!ActivityStreams]] should have unique global identifiers.
	      ActivityPub extends this requirement; all objects distributed by the
	      ActivityPub protocol MUST have unique global identifiers; these identifiers
	      must fall into one of the following groups:</p>
	      <ol>
	        <li>HTTPS URIs with their authority belonging to that of their originating
	        server.</li>
	        <li>An ID explicitly specified as the JSON <code>null</code> object, which
	        implies an anonymous object (a part of its parent context)</li>
	      </ol>
	      <p>A server receiving an object with no specified <code>id</code> should
	      allocate an object ID in the user's namespace and attach it to the posted
	      object.</p>
	      <p>All objects must have the following properties:</p>
	      <dl>
	        <dt>@id</dt><dd>The object's unique global identifier</dd>
	        <dt>@type</dt><dd>The type of the object</dd>
	      </dl>
	    </section>
	
	    <section id="obj-uri">
	      <h2>Dereferenceable Object URIs</h2>
	      <p>As illustrated by the example in the previous section, it is sometimes
	      necessary to dereference an object in order to retrieve its contents. It
	      is therefore first necessary to identify the URI to dereference. The
	      procedure for doing this depends upon which of the URI groups defined in
	      the previous section the ID belongs to:</p>
	      <ol>
	        <li>If the object's ID is a HTTPS URI, it must be directly dereferencable</li>
	        <li>Objects with a <code>null</code> ID have no authority and are not
	        dereferencable (their content is a part of their parent object)</li>
	      </ol>
	    </section>
	    <section id="obj-methods">
	      <h2>Methods on objects</h2>
	      <p>There are several common operations upon social objects, which
	      are expressed using standard HTTP methods applied to the Object's
	      <a href="#obj-uri">dereferencable URI</a>. To avoid conflict with existing
	      standards (and hence support "multiprotocol" server implementations),
	      the scope of requests which servers are required to honor as defined in
	      this specification is limited as follows:</p>
	      <ul>
	        <li>Notwithstanding the following, the <code>DELETE</code> method will
	        always be honored as specified in <a href="#method-delete"></a></li>
	        <li>All non-idempotent operations shall have a request body.</li>
	        <li>For all operations with a request body, it MUST have the media type
	        <code>application/activity+json</code>, or where explicitly
	        permitted the <code>multipart/related</code> media type with a root part
	        of type <code>application/activity+json</code></li>
	        <li>Servers MAY use HTTP content negotiation as defined in [[!RFC7231]]
	        to select the type of data to return in response to a request. For
	        requests without a body, an <code>Accept</code> header MUST be
	        specified, and the behavior defined by this specification ONLY applies
	        if content negotiation results in the selection of the
	        <code>application/activity+json</code> media type. For requests
	        with a body, the client MAY omit the <code>Accept</code> header, in
	        which case the server MUST provide successful responses as defined by this
	        specification</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>Servers MAY implement other behavior for requests which do not comply
	      with the above requirements. (For example, servers may implement additional
	      legacy protocols, or may use the same URI for both HTML and
	      ActivityStreams representations of a resource)</p>
	      <p>Servers MAY require authorization as specified in
	      <a href="#authorization"></a>, and may additionally implement their own
	      authentication rules. Servers SHOULD fail requests which do not pass their
	      authorization or authentication checks with the appropriate HTTP error
	      code, or the 404 Not Found error code where the existence of the object
	      is considered private.</p>
	
	      <section id="method-get">

	        object stored on the server.</p>
	        <p>The server MUST insert an activity with the <code>@type</code> <code>Update</code>

	    <h2>Actors</h2>
	    <p>Actors in ActivityPub are represented by HTTP URI. When entered directly into a user interface (for
	    example on a login form), it is desirable to support simplified naming. For
	    this purpose cases, ID normalization SHOULD be performed as follows:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>If the entered ID is a valid URI, then it is to be used directly</li>
	      <li>Otherwise, the entered value should be considered invalid</li>

	        <h2>Outbox</h2>
	        <p>The <code>outbox</code> stream contains every object that the user
	        has ever published, subject to the ability of the requestor to retrieve
	        the object (That is, the contents of the outbox are filtered by the
	        permissions of the person reading it). If a user submits a request
	        without <a href="authorization">Authorization</a> the server should
	        respond with all of the <a href="public-addressing">Public</a> posts.</p>
	
	        <p>A client may submit an [[!ActivityStreams]] activity to the server
	        using a HTTP POST request to the dereferencable URI of the outbox collection.
	        In this case, the request's Content-Type MUST
	        be <code>application/activity+json</code>, and the request MUST be authenticated
	        with credentials authorized to act on behalf of the user to whom the
	        outbox belongs. Such submitted activities will be added to the front of
	        the feed retrieved by GET requests to the same endpoint.</p>

	        The inbox MUST be filtered according to the requester's permission; this
	        MAY include allowing read access only to the owning user</p>
	
	        <p>A server may submit a HTTP POST to the <a href="#obj-dereference">
	        dereferencable URI</a> of the <code>inbox</code> endpoint. This request
	        MUST be authenticated with the credentials of the user identified by the

	        MUST be of the [[!ActivityStreams]] content type; it MUST be a single activity.</p>
	
	        <p>The server MUST perform de-duplication of activities, whereby it
	        discards repeats of already delivered activities (this can occur if an
	        activity is addressed both to a user's followers, and a specific user
	        which happens to follow said user, and the server has failed to
	        de-duplicate the recipients list, for example). Such deduplication MUST
	        be performed by comparing the <code>@id</code> of the activities and
	        dropping any activities already seen.</p>

	    <h2>Notification and Delivery</h2>
	    <p>Notification and Delivery are two closely related acts. Notifications are
	    sent to <i>objects</i> and are used to perform updates on the
	    social graph, whilst delivery is the act of inserting an activity into a
	    recipient <i>agent's</i> inbox</p>
	    <section id="delivery">
	      <h2>Delivery</h2>
	      <p>Activity distribution and access control is per the audience targeting
	      properties from the [[!ActivityStreams]] specification. For each entry in the
	      addressing properties of an object, the server shall</p>
	      <ol>
	        <li>If the entry is a collection, then the server MUST dereference the
	        collection (with the user's credentials) and add each person in the
	        collection to the list of recipients for the message. Servers MUST
	        limit the number of layers of indirections through collections which
	        will be performed, which MAY be one.
	        <li>If the entry is not a collection, then the server MUST perform
	        discovery on the object (which may not be of person
	        <code>@type</code>) to discover its activity-inbox address
	        <li>Once the complete list of recipients has been determined, the
	        server MUST then deliver the activity to each recipient. For a federated
	        implementation, this must be done by performing a HTTP POST, with prohom
	        authorization as the submitting user, of the submitted activity body to
	        the URI of the <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> collection of each recipient
	      </ol>
	      <p>For federated servers performing delivery to a 3rd party server,
	      delivery SHOULD be performed asynchronously to completion of
	      the original activity submission request, and SHOULD additionally retry
	      delivery to recipients if it fails due to network error</p>
	      <p>If no recipients are specified, the user's preferred default audience
	      should be applied. The default value for the default audience is
	      implementation specific but MAY be the user's
	      <a href="#followers">followers</a> collection</p>
	      <p>In addition to delivery to recipients, the server MUST also perform
	      notification as specified by <a href="#notification"></a></p>

	    <section id="notification">
	      <h2>Notification</h2>
	      <p>When a user creates an activity (by submitting it to their
	      <a href="#outbox">outbox</a>), the server should perform <i>notification</i>.
	      Notification is the process of propogating awareness of the new activity to
	      the activity's origin server such that the origin can act upon the activity
	      (for example, notification that a user has liked an object is used to update
	      the object's like count) and distribute the activity to ensure that it is
	      propogated to the whole social graph which received the original object.</p>
	      <p>Notifications shall be sent to each of the following objects:</p>
	      <ul>
	        <li>The Objects specified by the activity's "object" and "target" properties</li>
	        <li>Any Objects specified in the activity object's "inReplyTo" property</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>An object notified of an activity MUST <a href="#delivery">deliver</a>
	      that activity to all <a href="#object-recipient">recipients of the object</a>

	    <section id="public-addressing">
	      <h2>Public Addressing</h2>
	      <p>In addition to [[!ActivityStreams]] collections and objects,
	      Activities may additionally be addressed to the special "public"
	      audience denoted by the object</p>
	      <pre class="example">

	    <h2>Binary Data</h2>
	    <p>There is the ability to submit binary data such as images, video or other

	       the binary data to the user's <code>file</code> endpoint. The request MUST contain
	       the HTTP headers <code>Content-Type</code> and <code>Content-Length</code>. Upon
	       successful submission a response containing the object with an ID is returned that
	       can be posted to the users outbox.</p>
